# JBrowser
Java based Browser using IE10 as a Web Client
JBrowser is a simple mess around project I created just to see what I could do with a SWT/JFace Application Window. 

Simple to use and has some helpful popups if things happen that shouldn't. This project is a side, "when bored" project, and as such I can't guarantee regular updates.
